This tutorial was created with the goal of helping individuals looking to create a podcast but have no prior experience with audio recording. By providing basic information and provide a foundation in audio recording/editing software such as Audacity and the various features available.

# Audacity Basics
######Start by copying and pasting or clicking the following link:[https://www.audacityteam.org/download/](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) into the search bar. The website provides 3 options, click on the one that is supported by your computer.

######Once you have audacity installed, you can start recording immediately, but it is a good idea to look over and familiarize the tools it provides.
##Familiarizing yourself with Audacity and its Tools
######Upon opening audacity, at the top left of the window you have your basic tools

- Other useful tools such as cut, copy, paste, undo and redo tools can also be found near by in the tool bar.
Below that you have the timeline, perhaps the useful reference point in the program.

- Before you start recording your first podcast, it is advised that you make some sample recordings to get a feel for the program. 
- These sample recordings should be long enough to practice editing the length of the recording and messing around the envelope tool (pictured).

An important effect to know is the Fade in/Fade out effect. For instance, if you are starting your podcast, it is a good idea to fade into on out to avoid rather adbrupt start and ending. 

Additionally it can be useful to add a couple of recordings to learn how to layer audio files. A useful skill if you are wanting to add background music. Having multiple layers will look someting like this:

##Editing and adding Background Music
- Editing is pretty straight forward in audacity
you can use your curser to highlight recording files. 
For example, if you would like to delete a portion of a recording, highlight the portion and you wish to delete and simply press delete.

#####If you have just made a recording it is strongly recommended to export it immediately to WAV or AIFF as a safety copy before you start editing. This can be done by:
	File > Export > Export Audio...
	
Once you have your first recording saved, start from the beginning and listen to the entire recording before making any changes.

####Importing Audio Files and Envelope Tool
#####Fading music out somewhat so that it continues to play in the background but that a speaking track can still be recognised is a useful skill to learn to create an interesting and richer podcast.
	-File Menu > Import > Audio

-It is important to look at waveforms as this indicates how loud or soft the recording(s) are:

- As you can see in the picture above, the wavelengths in the middle are going to quiter than the wave lengths on the outside.
- This is essential to know so you can dampen the music, allowing you talk and not yell over the background noise.
- This action is easy to perform with the envelope tool.
- To utilize the envelope tool, click the envelope tool, then click anywhere on the recording to create a control point

- To fade the reording add another control point and move it down so the wavelengths are closer

###Trimming
trimming a recording is also very simple

###Fades
Applying fades to selected audio such that the amplitude of the selection goes from absolute silence to the original amplitude (Fade In), or from the original amplitude to absolute silence (Fade Out). 

- Its standard to fade in and out at least a second of the audio file.

#####Fade In
- To fade in, simply highlight the audio file and then

`Effect>Fade In`

Should Look Somthing Like:

#####Fade Out
To fade out, simply highlight the audio file and then
`Effect>Fade Out`

Should Look Somthing Like:

##Exporting and Saving 
- Upon finishing your first podcast save the original audacity file so you can go back and make changes if need be.
- In order to upload your file to iTunes or windows media player, you will need to export the file as a Mp3 file. `File>Export>Mp3`
- To upload the podcast onto iTunes, you have to perform the following
`File>Export>WAV or AIFF`
